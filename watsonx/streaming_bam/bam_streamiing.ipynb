But if done behind your back then its meaning changes again: this time around people will think about cheating on their partner because they have been caught by surprise while doing something wrong like looking at another person for too long without realizing what was happening between them both before getting noticed themselves which could lead into trouble later down road depending how serious things get from thereon out so better watch yourself when using such gestures especially ones involving hands since these types usually carry strong connotations associated within different cultures worldwide including ours here today known simply as 'the mafia'."
